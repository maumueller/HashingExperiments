# Performance of different hash functions in Cuckoo Hashing

Source code used in the hashing experiments of the thesis [On the Analysis of
Two Randomized Algorithms: Multi-Pivot Quicksort and Efficient Hash Functions](http://pkqs.net/~tre/aumueller_dissertation.pdf).

## Hashing Functions

The following hash functions are compared: 
- Polynomial hashing (using the Carter-Wegman-Trick)
- Multiply-Shift
- Tabulation-Hashing 
- Tabulation + Universal hashing (ADW)
- Murmur3

## Dependencies


Needs g++, cmake in version >= 2.8, libboost-random and libpapi for performance
measurements. (Enabled by default, can be changed in CMakeLists.txt.)

## How to build

Use the following commands on the top-level directory of the project.

> mkdir build; cd build
> cmake ..
> make

For a release build with optimization flags, use 
> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

After successful compilation, the executable is located at
build/src/hashingtest.

## Examples

Example calls can be found in the directory _examples_.

## Evaluation
The output generated by the program can be directly read and processed using the beautiful [SqlPlotTools](https://github.com/bingmann/sqlplot-tools).
